This project is a software capable of managing firewall policies and monitor a network, performing packet inspection and classifying connections as its protocols. The implemented software performs tracking of network connections, blocking or alerting, via instant messaging, the occurrence of certain connections.

A interface developed in GWT with a Python backend is also available, providing log reading and rule editing.
